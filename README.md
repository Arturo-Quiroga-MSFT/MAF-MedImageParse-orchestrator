# Healthcare Agent Orchestrator

> Production-ready healthcare agent orchestrator for MedImageParse using **Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)**

## Overview

This repository contains a complete implementation of a healthcare agent orchestrator that transforms Azure's MedImageParse from a standalone medical image segmentation API into a production-ready clinical decision support system using **Microsoft Agent Framework**.

### Why Microsoft Agent Framework?

Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) is the next-generation framework combining the best of Semantic Kernel and AutoGen, providing:
- üîÑ **Workflow Orchestration**: Sequential, concurrent, and conditional agent coordination
- üéØ **Type Safety**: Strong typing for reliable multi-agent communication
- üîç **Built-in Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration for tracing
- üèóÔ∏è **Enterprise-Grade**: Thread-based state management and extensive model support

### Core Agent Components (MAF):

1. **Image Preprocessing Agent** - DICOM parsing, format conversion, windowing
2. **Prompt Generation Agent** - Modality-specific, anatomically accurate prompts
3. **MedImageParse Inference Agent** - API orchestration with error handling
4. **Validation & QA Agent** - Quality metrics and confidence scoring
5. **Post-Processing Agent** - Mask refinement and clinical measurements
6. **Report Generation Agent** - Structured clinical reports
7. **Integration Agent** - PACS/EHR connectivity and DICOM storage

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Arturo-Quiroga-MSFT/MAF-MedImageParse-orchestrator.git
cd MAF-MedImageParse-orchestrator

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Azure OpenAI and MedImageParse endpoints
```

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from healthcare_orchestrator import HealthcareOrchestrator, Settings
from healthcare_orchestrator.models.schemas import MedicalImageInput, ImageModality

async def main():
    settings = Settings()  # Loads from .env
    
    image_input = MedicalImageInput(
        study_id="STUDY-001",
        patient_id="PATIENT-001",
        modality=ImageModality.CT,
        image_path="/path/to/ct_scan.dcm"
    )
    
    async with HealthcareOrchestrator(settings) as orchestrator:
        # Option 1: Streaming processing
        async for update in orchestrator.process_medical_image_streaming(image_input):
            print(update, end="", flush=True)
        
        # Option 2: Standard processing
        result = await orchestrator.process_medical_image(image_input)
        print(f"Status: {result.status}")
        print(f"Masks: {len(result.segmentation_masks)}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Relationship to the official Azure-Samples project

There is a related Microsoft-maintained sample repository with the same high-level name: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/healthcare-agent-orchestrator. That project is a broad, end-to-end multi-agent accelerator which includes deployment templates (azd/Bicep), a React client, Microsoft Teams integration, many pre-built agents (patient history, radiology, clinical trials, research), and full infrastructure and deployment guidance.

This repository intentionally differs in scope:

- Scope and intent: This codebase is a compact, Python-first orchestrator focused on MedImageParse-based medical image segmentation workflows and a small set of specialized agents (preprocessing, prompt generation, MedImageParse inference, validation, post-processing, reporting, integration). The Azure-Samples project is a wider accelerator and deployment reference for many healthcare agent scenarios.
- Complexity: The Azure-Samples repo provides production-ready infra, app/client code, notebooks, Teams installers, and extensive deployment docs. This repository is lightweight and intended to be used as a programmatic library or reference for MedImageParse orchestration without requiring full infra or Teams setup.
- Interoperability: Both projects are permissively licensed (MIT). That means you are free to reuse, adapt, or contribute code across projects while following the respective contribution and trademark guidance in the Microsoft repo if you plan to contribute upstream.

Why keep both?

- This repository serves users who want a small, easy-to-consume Python SDK/reference specifically for MedImageParse flows (no infra or UI required). It can also act as an adapter/agent implementation that could be plugged into larger orchestrators like the Azure-Samples project.
